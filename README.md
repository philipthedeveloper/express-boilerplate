# EXPRESS-BOILERPLATE

Check me out on github: [github/philipthedeveloper](https://github.com/philipthedeveloper)

This boilerplate was created with the initial connection being to MongoDB using mongoose. Feel free to customize it to suit your taste.

It is recommended that other unused packages like **jsonwebtoken** and **bcryptjs** should be pruned out if not used.

Furthermore, it is recommended that some relevant fields in the the package.json file be editted before use. Such fields are:

* **name**
* **version**
* **description**
* **author**
* **license**
